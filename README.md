## 🚀 Overview

VeritasAI is a full-stack web application designed to help users distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. Unlike simple classifiers, VeritasAI employs a **Tri-Layer Analysis Engine**:

1.  **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates Perplexity and Burstiness to detect the "uniformity" typical of AI.
2.  **Linguistic Patterns**: Analyzes sentence structure, readability scores (ARI), and vocabulary richness.
3.  **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a fine-tuned Transformer model (RoBERTa/GPT-2) for semantic classification.

---

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Real-Time Analysis**: Instant probability scoring.
*   ** detailed Metrics**: Visual gauges for specific metrics like "Burstiness" and "Perplexity".
*   **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism-based design using React & Tailwind CSS.
*   **PDF Reports**: Generate professional verification certificates.
*   **Privacy First**: No data is stored; analysis happens in memory.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is split into two distinct parts that run simultaneously:

*   **Frontend (`/frontend`)**: Built with **React**, running on Port `5173`. It sends the user's text to the backend.
*   **Backend (`/backend`)**: Built with **FastAPI** (Python), running on Port `8000`. It processes the text and returns scores.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer.

1.  **Python 3.9+** (Required for the AI Brain)
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    *   *Important*: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
2.  **Node.js v18+** (Required for the User Interface)
    *   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3.  **Git** (To clone the project)
    *   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 🛠 Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps exactly to set up the project.

### 1. Clone the Project
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saicharan-bhuthkuri/VeritasAI.git
cd VeritasAI
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python)
This sets up the AI server.

**Step 2a: Create a Virtual Environment**
This keeps project dependencies isolated.
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 2b: Activate the Environment**
*   **Windows:**
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
*   **Mac/Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*(You will see `(venv)` appear at the start of your command line)*

**Step 2c: Install Dependencies**
This downloads necessary libraries like PyTorch and spaCy.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: This may take a few minutes as `torch` is a large file.*

**Step 2d: Download Language Model**
Required for linguistic analysis.
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (Node.js)
This sets up the user interface.

**Step 3a: Navigate to Frontend**
Open a new terminal or `cd ..` back to the root, then:
```bash
cd frontend
```

**Step 3b: Install Packages**
```bash
npm install
```

---

## ▶ Running the Application

### Option A: The "One-Click" Script (Recommended for Windows)

We have provided a script that does everything for you.
1.  Navigate to the root `VeritasAI` folder.
2.  Double-click `start_all.bat` OR runs it in the terminal:
    ```bash
    .\start_all.bat
    ```
3.  Wait for **two windows** to open.
    *   One window runs the Backend (API).
    *   One window runs the Frontend (UI).

### Option B: Manual Start

If you prefer to run them separately:

**Terminal 1 (Backend)**
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```
*Server will start at `http://localhost:8000`*

**Terminal 2 (Frontend)**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
*App will start at `http://localhost:5173`*

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q: I see "Failed to fetch" error on the website.
**A:** This means the Frontend cannot talk to the Backend.
1. Avoid closing the terminal windows.
2. Ensure the Backend is running on port `8000`.
3. Check the backend terminal for any crash errors.

### Q: "pip" or "python" is not recognized.
**A:** You likely didn't add Python to your system PATH during installation. Reinstall Python and ensure the checkbox **"Add Python to PATH"** is selected.

### Q: The installation is stuck on `torch`.
**A:** PyTorch is a large library (>2GB). Depending on your internet speed, it may take 5-10 minutes to download. Please be patient.

### Q: "Script is disabled on this system" error?
**A:** On PowerShell, you might need to allow script execution. Run this command as Admin:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
